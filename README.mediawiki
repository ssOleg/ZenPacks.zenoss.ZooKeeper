They are each detailed further below.
* Discovery and periodic remodeling of ZooKeeper component.
* Performance monitoring.
* Event monitoring.
* Optional service impact with addition of Zenoss Service Dynamics product.

The following component will be automatically discovered through the ZooKeeper port you provide:
; ZooKeeper
: ''Attributes'': Name, Mode, Status, Node Count, ZooKeeper Version, Zxid

=== Performance Monitoring ===
The following metrics will be collected and graphed every 5 minutes by default:
; ZooKeeper
: ''Metrics'': Outstanding Requests, Received/Sent Packets, Connections, Avg/Min/Max Latencies

=== Event monitoring ===
The following events will be triggered:
; ZooKeeper

When combined with the Zenoss Service Dynamics product, this ZenPack adds
built-in service impact capability for ZooKeeper. The following service impact
relationships are automatically added. These will be included in any services
containing one or more of the explicitly mentioned entities.
;Service Impact Relationships
* ZooKeeper is affected by hosting Device failure.
;External Impact Relationships
* ZooKeeper failure affects associated Hadoop Data Node, Secondary Name Node, Job Tracker, Task Tracker, Resource Manager, Node Manager and Job History.

== Usage ==
Use the following steps to start monitoring ZooKeeper server:
# Select ''Infrastructure'' from the navigation bar.
# Click the device name in the device list. The device overview page appears.
# Select ''Configuration Properties'' from the left panel.
# Set ''zZooKeeperPort'' if ZooKeeper port differs from the default one (2181).
# Navigate to the ''Modeler plugins'' page of the device containing your ZooKeeper server and add the ''ZooKeeperCollector'' modeler plugin.
# Select ''Model device'' from the gear menu.

----


Alternatively you can use zenbatchload to add ZooKeeper monitoring servers from the command line.
To do this, you must create a text file with hostname and ZooKeeper port of all the
servers you want to add. The devices should be added under the target machine device class
(e.g. '/Devices/Server/Linux' in the example below).
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
/Devices/Server/Linux zCollectorPlugins=['ZooKeeperCollector']
<HOST NAME> zZooKeeperPort='2181'
</syntaxhighlight>
You can then load the ZooKeeper monitoring servers into Zenoss Core or Resource Manager as devices with the following command.
<console>
$ ##i##zenbatchload <filename>
</console>

== Troubleshooting ==
Please refer to the Zenoss Service Dynamics documentation if you run into
any of the following problems:
* ZenPack will not install
* Adding a device fails
* Don't understand how to add a device
* Don't understand how to model a device
If you cannot find the answer in the documentation, then Resource Manager (Service Dynamics)
